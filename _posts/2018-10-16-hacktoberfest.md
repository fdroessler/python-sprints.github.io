The London Python sprints group started a year ago, and since then we
organised more than 20 sprints. Contributing to projects such as pandas,
dateutil, Tornado, or the python.org website.

This time we will be participating in the [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/).
No matter if this is your first sprint or if you are a seasoned sprinter with us, everyone is welcome.

The Hacktoberfest is a great way to get started with contributing to open-source and you even
get to win a t-shirt if you contribute 5 pull requests by the end of October.

Rules from the website:
To get a shirt, you must make five pull requests (PRs) between October 1â€“31 in any timezone.
PRs can be to any public repo on GitHub, not just the ones highlighted.
The PR must contain commits you made yourself.
PRs reported by maintainers as spam or that are automated will be marked as invalid and won't count towards the shirt.
This year, the first 50,000 of you can earn a T-shirt (compared with 30,000 in 2017).

There will be a few of us present to get you started so make sure you secure yourself a spot.

Remember to:

- Bring your own laptop
- Check out the [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) website if you want to get an early start.
- Join the [Gitter channel](https://gitter.im/py-sprints/hacktoberfest2018) of the sprint
